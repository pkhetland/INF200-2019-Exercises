''' We implement the skeleton of Snakes and ladders games using a set of 
functions.
The rules are as follows:

1. Each player has one figure, which starts at the imaginary square 0 to the 
   left of square 1.
2. Each time it is a playerâ€™s turn, she throws a six-sided die and moves
   her figure the given number of fields forward.
3. If the figure stops on a field at the bottom of a ladder, 
   the figure moves immediately up the ladder.
4. If the figure stops on a field at the top of a chute, 
   the figure moves immediately down the chute.
5. The game ends when the first player reaches (or passes) field 90.
